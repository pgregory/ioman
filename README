A RenderMan binding for Io.

To build, clone the repo into your 'addons' folder under the name 'RenderMan', i.e.

   $: cd io/addons
   $: git clone git://github.com/pgregory/ioman.git RenderMan

Then from the root Io folder, build as any other Io addon, i.e.

   $: cd io
   $: make RenderMan
   $: make install
